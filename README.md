Task:

Convert post/PostForm.js to be Typescript with JSX, i.e. PostForm.tsx

I've already converted the two other Javascript JSX files in post/ to Typescript:
- post/POstMessage.tsx
- postList.tsx

plus one (new one) in plain ts (for the interface):
postInterface.js

App is simple blog app for training and learning.

Not homework or interview but this is the approach I use to learn.

Please do a separate branch and pull request
I won't merge it and repo is a disposable one but this lets me see the diff most easily so I can learn from it and apply it elsewhere.

$20 for this, should be easy given it's a working app with some tsx files already working
